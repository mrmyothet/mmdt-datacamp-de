# Performing a Code Review

- Review the definition of the prepare_smartphone_data() function to ensure the code is well-documented and is easily "readable". 
- Update the existing code to remedy any issues with documentation or readability.
- Review and update the prepare_smartphone_data() function to ensure that it adheres to PEP-8 principles.
- Review code in the visualize_versus_price() function for adherence to DRY principles. Use the column_to_label() function to remove any logic that was previously duplicated.
- Review the unit test written below to ensure the test matches logic in the prepare_smartphone_data() function, and make changes as needed. Run the cell to validate the test passes when executed.
